# php-javascript-chat

Simple 'Chat' application with the backend in PHP.

A user is able to register their name upon clicking on the option to 'join chat'.

A user is then able to send a message to the chat.



A user is then able to visualize his/her own messages in the chat box as well as those sent by other users.

All messages are stored in a simple SQLite file db.

Calls to the backend are done via ajax calls.

User information is stored in the localStorage until the user decided to leave the chat.
